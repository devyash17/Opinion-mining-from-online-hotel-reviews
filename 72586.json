Parking and breakfast was included with our nightly stay. Explaining about the breakfast buffet and where to park, and since there was four of us in one room he would be sending up extra towel. Thank you. All this and check in was speedy taking only minutes to check us in and get to know us. The rooms were comfy and very clean.

There is a breakfast,dining lounge but that also is an extra cost.It's a full buffet breakfast not the usual Best Western express fare..There was a good selection of foods and the staff wait your tables to offer beverages.My only complaint was that the head of the dining room was a little too tense and he made us feel pressured if we hadn't left the dining room by the end of breakfast time.I am guessing that the reason being is that many conferences are held at the hotel due to it's central location and the dining room is in constant use during the day so the head is on a tight schedule.However if you miss breakfast at the hotel there are many alternatives close by.There's a Whole Foods about ten minutes walk away. Our favorite dinner spot was a late night pizza place called Bambino's.They are very low key and offer a select menu of wood-fired pizzas and fresh Italian salads at reasonable prices.

There is also a business center with 4 computers if you need to check email or do some internet surfing and didn't bring your own computer. They have excellent room service and the staff are all very friendly and helpful. One time our daughter messed up the microwave and we asked for help. A service person came to the room right away. It was just a programming error and he showed us what happened. We also asked to have a room with a view and they happily switched our rooms so we could enjoy the view of the space needle...no questions asked. The rooms are clean with plenty of space. We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds, there was a nice tv with hd channels. There is also a nice big chair to relax in after a long day. They have a room safe if you need to keep some important documents there. They have a coffee machine and provide you with a paper in the morning. One thing of note is that this is a green friendly hotel. The soap is available in a dispenser and they provide you with options if you don't want to participate in their green program. There is a mcdonalds just accross the street from the hotel if you need a quick bite to eat. One thing you should be aware of is that they charge for parking $15+tax a night....works out to $18.60..however you are allowed to leave your vehicle there for the day.

Third-party prices fill otherwise unsold rooms, and provide the hotel with opportunities to sell services and win future business. My advice to Priceline customers: pay attention to reviews, articulate your needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet and you bought from Priceline, tell Priceline in writing; use snail mail to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found them responsive. Talk to local management directly, pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational.] COMMENDABLE: Exceptional central location: two blocks from the Space Needle, close to other Seattle Center theatres and monorail (which gets you to 3rd and Pine, central downtown, nearby the Public Market and all downtown. and exceptional public transportation all over Seattle. Queen Anne business district is 5 minutes away on #8 bus, only needed if walking is challenging. Big QFC market, 3 blocks; bigger (and pricier) Metropolitan Market in Queen Anne. Seniors note: Reduced fare \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Orca\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd card, good on all busses and light rail, available at manned kiosk inside Westlake Rail Station. Paid street and lot parking nearby (expensive at hotel). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Walgreens at 6th and Denny, one block. In room: one-use wrapped plastic glasses and paper coffee cups; refrigerator and microwave, excellent hot water supply; good bedding and pillows. Good and responsive below-window heat and cool control. Substitutes wall dispenser in bathroom for individual toiletries, an \"eco\" nod. Primary downtown stop for QuickShuttle bus to and from Vancouver. Hotel does not have self-service coin laundry but will direct you to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Loyal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Best Western, sister hotel 3 blocks away, for this. Working printer in business center (off lobby). I can recommend this hotel with some caveats below. CHALLENGING: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Complimentary High Speed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd internet is meaningless because system has inadequate bandwidth to serve too many users: consequence is poor download speeds and very frequent failure to open pages. Complex pages and downloads are especially troublesome with pitiful speeds (17-25 KB/sec, way below industry average. Frequent failure of door key cards; staff will tell you \u00e2\u20ac\u0153your fault, demagnetized in your wallet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but unless you are carrying magnets, this is diversionary and the real issue is likely old, faulty coding equipment or door readers, both expensive to replace. Often long waits at front desk for small issues, easily solved by devising communication between staff to respond with backup when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s busy. Non-working remote, pointed out to the (tipped) housekeeping staff but then ignored. TRANSPORTATION TIPS: Cars are a hassle unless you must drive through or out of city. Plan for arrival without a car: light rail from SeaTac airport, exit at Westlake (terminus) then cab from 5th and Pine--too far if you have luggage. Tip: Use \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get directions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feature of google to reliably plan in-city transportation. At all costs avoid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GO-Shuttle Express\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shared ride service from airport, utterly chaotic dispatch in terminal gets my award for worst of airport shuttles. Company does not respond to customer service issues, leaves its harried drivers and dispatch staff to field complaints, does not return calls. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll wait hours in the cold to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dispatched\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd even if you have a (meaningless) reservation.

Tip 2: If you reserved, insist on a refund if they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dispatch you within ten minutes, and explain you'll dispute the prepaid credit charge if you are refused.

The hotel is just a short walk (1 block) to the Seattle center, bus stops and the monorail that takes you into town.( the monorail is fun!)

When we got to the hotel he charged $50 and said the clerk told us wrong. I called the clerk and asked on the speaker phone and was told $ 30 again. The driver said he was referring to another company. So I paid. Inside the clerk said he never quoted a price. It was 12 pm and the room would not be ready until 4 pm so we stored the luggage and checked in. The rate we were quoted was on the reservation which I had and was $45 less than what he was going to charge. He changed the rate to the agreed upon rate. They advertise a $4.95 full breakfast buffet but charge $6.95 for one of the worst breakfasts I have ever seen. No regular coffee only decaf and it was Luke warm. No fruit. No bacon and the eggs wer cold. There is a McDonalds one block away which had a better breakfast for $3.50 Since you have a microwave and refrig in the room we bought milk and cereal at a store Longe with a coffee cake. Putting everything in the refridgerator we went sight seeing. The next morning we got the milk out and it was warm. Icalled to the front desk and said the fridge stopped working. The said I should have turned the switch back on to run it. I was never told about a switch on the fridge The trip back to the airport in a cab cost. $32 not $60luke the clerck said.

The Executive Inn is a block away from McDonald's and two blocks away from the Space Needle and monorail. The Executive Inn was a good value for the location, and I was able to walk over from the monorail station after taking the LINK from the airport to Westlake Mall and then transferring onto the monorail at Westlake. The only problem I had with the motor inn was the noise. The people in the room next door to me had their tv blasting away at 10 P.M. while I was trying to sleep. They were so loud that I could hear every word they were saying. At one point, the woman asked her male companion to turn down the tv so that she didn't \"need to shout over it\". She needn't have bothered, he didn't turn it down, and she was so loud, he didn't need to. My husband managed to fall asleep despite the noise only to be woken up at 10:15 P.M, when someone knocked on our door. They went away before we could see who it was. You could also hear toilets flushing through walls, and loud talking from guests getting off the nearby elevator. There is a fire station nearby, so you can also hear when they respond to calls. There were also plumbers who were talking outside the hotel at 4:00 A.M. before driving off, and the trash dumpsters were serviced at 5:40 A.M. To the hotel's credit, I did receive a response to my complaint's about the noise mentioned in a hotel survey I completed. I was asked if I complained about the loud tv/talking next door, (I did not), and management promised to address the noise problems at future meetings. When I had encountered a loud tv previously at my stay in another hotel, I had complained, and security told me after responding to the complaint that the room was found to be empty with just the tv blasting which they then turned off- end of problem. Since there were two people in the room next door this time, and they were well aware that the tv was too loud, I didn't see the point in complaining, but at least it is nice to know that the hotel management probably would have told them to turn it down had they been asked. I recommend this hotel with reservations. If you plan to stay out sightseeing late and don't plan on going to bed until midnight anyway, or if you are a heavy sleeper, then the noise issues probably won't be a concern. For guests like me who are taking cruises from Pier 91, take the #24 bus to the pier rather than the hotel's town car (cost is $2 for the bus, $8 for hotel's town car, pp).", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "OhMai", "Title": "\u201cOur saviours! ~3.5/5???

I loved how we were allowed to keep our car in the gated parking garage until 6pm, that allowed us to take the Monorail the next day. The room was clean, and the beds were comfy. The shower pressure was perfect and water was hot enough. I honestly can't say anything bad about this hotel. From the moment you step in, everything looked well kept and managed. Even in the restaurant, the manager took his time to greet customers and help out the staff. The breakfast was $5 for hotel guests but it was well worth every penny!

After outstanding service and hotels throughout Oregon including a stop at another Best Western, we were expecting a nice night to complete our vacation. Nothing could have been further from the truth with this place. Having stayed a numerous Best Western hotels throughout Canada and the US, I expected a certain level of service and amenities. The front desk staff are not interested in their guests and in fact made us feel like they were doing us a favour. After finally getting to our floor (the elevators are beyond slow and no stairs to be found), the hallway was dark, dingy and certainly not up to the level that would be expected from a Best Western. The room doors are beat up and look dirty, the ceiling is low and the hallways are dark. The room was clean although it has certainly seen better days. As there are few restaurants in the area, we decided to eat at the restaurant. The food was good although overpriced, the young lady who \"greeted\" us could not have been less interested in her job. Our server was very nice and service was prompt. Following dinner, I returned to our car to get something. On the way back, it was almost comical with the length of time it took to get into an elevator - people were left waiting for another car...again no stairs in sight. In the hallway, things went from bad to worse...a disgusting bug of some nature was wandering in the hall, which I killed...still wonder how many more there were! We had booked a room with 2 queen beds, which should indicate that a number of people may be staying in the room. The coffee maker in the room comes with enough coffee for 1 cup. Unless of course someone wants decaf. So at most, there were would be 2 cups of coffee. The complimentary breakfast was among the most unappealing we experienced on our trip. The water in the scrambled eggs should have been a tip-off but I still took some, one bite was more than enough. With one staff member for a 4th of July weekend, finding a clean spoon became an epic adventure and again very little interest was shown in meeting the needs of the guests. Upon check-out, the young lady at the desk was completely unable to meet the basic level of customer service. At no time did she ask if my stay had been okay or any other interest in our impressions. Following a very silent transaction, she did not thank us for our business or even wish us a good trip. The location of this hotel is good for the Space Needle and another attractions.

If not, we would just drive down to the waterfront and do through the aquarium. We were told by the hotel employee that she could not answer that over the phone, we need to go in to find out the answer. I realize that the answer to this question has several different variables: room availability, company policy, etc. However, we had traveled across the state with two kids and were just asking if it would be possible. I would have been happy to check in later. Once we arrived, we were checked in by the same individual that we had just spoken with. We were behind another couple that was checking in and I overheard the employee provide instructions to the couple ahead of us. After checking in, we were told that there was a daily parking charge of $15, which while somewhat reasonable, was not advertised at the time of the reservation. The unnamed employee (no nametag visible) then offered assistance to the next people in line to check in. At which point, I asked where the parking was. I received a blank look in return. After getting that it was below the building, I went to park my car. Now, I must comment that the parking garage leaves a LOT to be desired. The two handicapped spots that are next to the elevator are only marked for compact vehicles. I do not drive a compact vehicle. I can accept existing parking garage design restrictions prevent ideal parking spaces. I can also acknowledge that while they might meet the letter of the law for American with Disabilities Act, it does not make it convenient in any way. I was able to locate a parking spot further away from the elevator. But that presented a problem in itself. When my wife tried to bring the luggage cart to the car, she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The parking structure had a height restriction of 6 foot. The cart was taller than 6 foot. I was able to tilt the cart over and drag it through this height restricted area because it was empty. But, once loaded with our luggage, I could no longer perform this feat. I will point out that you can go around the parking garage to the other side where the height restriction allows the cart to pass through loaded. However, as previously mentioned, I am handicapped and walking any distance is rather difficult. Walking into my room was like hitting a wall of cheap cologne. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if the smell was supposed to cover up a more foul stench, or if it was from the previous occupant. Either way, it was rather unpleasant, if not survivable. I proceeded to sit in the nice comfy chair only to find out that all the comfy qualities of said chair were worn out. The arms of the char were not nicely padded, instead the wood frame wound up digging into my arms. Sense I was on my long awaited vacation, I figured that I would make the best of things. I then took off my shoes and socks, I like walking around barefoot on carpet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small guilty pleasure after having my foot in and out of casts for four years. I walked across the room to splash some water on my face only to find that my feet stuck to the carpet with every step. I put my socks back on. Jump ahead to my shower experience. I will acknowledge that your hotel has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gone Green,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and while the shower head might be eco friendly, it is not person friendly. A high pressure, low volume nozzle is more fitting in a C&C environment, not in a shower. I found that the extra time spent trying to rinse off countered any water saving qualities that the shower head offers. The Elevators are smooth if not very slow. I am sure that this is a constant complaint, but let me address this. While waiting for the elevators, after several minutes, I began to look around for the stairs. I saw on the wall next to the elevators a sign indicating in case of a fire, use the stairs. Great sign, really useful to those that are unaccustomed to elevators, however, I saw no signs as to where these stairs were. Now, up until now I have talked about comfort features. This is a real safety issue. On day two, I was talking to another hotel patron about the long wait for the elevator. He mentioned to me that there are stairs at both ends of the hall, but they do not go down to the lobby. The stairs apparently only lead to the outside. For being an eco friendly hotel, not providing the option for stairs instead of the elevator seems a little short sighted. I know that this addresses a structure issue and not one easily overcome without major building modifications. I can say that the room had a very nice view of the Space Needle and was conveniently located next to the EMP, Space Needle, and the Pacific Science Center. But the hotel description fails to mention the fire station that must reside next to it. Between the sirens going off all night and the people running screaming down the hall, I found it really rather difficult to get any sleep. I will take the blame for not reporting the screamer to the front desk. By that time, I had pretty well given up on sleep and found it a distraction from the sirens. The four days and three nights that we spent in this hotel sounds more like a comedy of errors that the tragic experience that it was. When I spend my vacation time and my money on a hotel room, I expect far more that what I received. That being said, the experience was not a complete waste. After having spent my vacation in this hotel, I have absolutely no desire to stay in any other Best Western hotel again.

The Best Western Executive Inn is located directly next to the Space Needle and the city's monorail system. The monorail gives large groups access to the Seattle downtown without the excessive costs of bussing at virtually all times of the day. The proximity of the Space Needle keeps the surrounding area safe at all times of the day, and the hotel itself is well-lit and nicely maintained. The interior of the hotel has a small but comfortable lobby, as well as a full-service restaurant and bar, while the rooms themselves are spacious and very clean. The restaurant offers an incredible daily breakfast to large groups that includes: eggs, roasted potatos, sausage, waffles, bagels, pastries, a variety of cereals, juices, fresh fruit, coffee and tea that is far better than I have had at many more \"high-end\" locations. Beyond this, because of the variety of options, this breakfast is uniquely suited to the finicky appetities of younger travelers, and thereby ensures that all in your group will be equally satisfied. Most importantly, the staff at the Executive Inn is just superb. Knowing how large groups can often require additional attention to make sure that all needs are met, the staff at Best Western is always ready to do what is necessary to ensure that your group gets what they need to be comfortable and satisfied. This willingness to positively work with groups to keep things going smoothly makes things beeter for your group, and consequently all of the other guests in the hotel as well.

Staff on the whole were friendly enough, though not the standard expected when staying or visiting somewhere in the USA. There was one particular woman on receiption we nicknamed PPMT (Permanent PMT), none of the staff wore name badges so I can't name her, but she was in her 20's with short blond(ish) bobbed hair, she was rude, short conversationalist and just downright customer unfriendly. The girlfriend of one of my friends who stayed with us, rung from home and also complained to us about her and her attitiude. She described her attitude perfectly to us and it couldn't have been anyone else. There were times we thought that it was a bad day, but no the 3 times we saw her there, she was the same!! Anyway, the hotel is an okay. The rooms are pretty standard though the walls pretty thin, in fact we were able to do tap on our friends wall in the room next to us if we wanted them instead of ringing, and were able hear one of our friends snoring too!! The windows are too thin also, our cheaper rated hotel room didn't have a view of the space needle, so I only assume that the windows are thicker for the richer guests. I say this because every morning, whether you like it or nor you get woken up in the morning by he sound of TWO HELICOPTERS. They come from the local TV news buildings, Komo 4 news, and another news broadcaster that I can't remember the name of. Added with this is almost constant noise from police, fire and ambulance sirens. In the end I bought ear-plugs and slept very well - this is a tip to be highly receommended!! A small gripe from an \"international\" visitors point of view, is that the TV had no international TV stations, there is around 80 to choose from and not one is world news, for example BBC World or CNN International. This is as i say a small gripe, as you can use the internet for free in the \"business center\" which is just a very small room with two computers in it, if you want to catch up on things back home etc. The breakfast buffet is also ok, though after staying there for 6 days (we used the hotel as a base for different excursions), it was became samey. Your selection is potato wedges, chippolatas, scrambled egg (which was also square shaped as though it literally had just come out of can), waffles, 2-3 choices of cereal and oatmeal, bananas, 3 juices and tea and coffee. Good points are that's it is VERY close to the Space Needle (which itself is over rated as we later found out that you can go up the Columbia Center building in downtown which is 75 floors up instead of 42! and gives better panoramic views). The space needle has a monorail whoch connects you to downtown within 2-3 minutes and a return trip for $4 it's not a bad way of travelling into to the city. The hotel has friendly bar staff and, rarely for a hotel (I think), a pool table which was frequented by us a couple of times. Best of all for us, was that it was near to a great bar called SPORT, and as the name suggests it's a sports bar with the friendliest bar staff you can meet, what a find that was. Good food too, and just a two minute walk from the hotel. The car park, despite the critism I've read is very secure, ok you have to pay for the parking space, but I'd much rather have to do that than leave it outdoors. We saw two men forcing money out of the parking meters in the car park opposite one morning, and no doubt they had a look around the cars in the car park to see anything valuable was on display before raiding the machines!!

I almost always go through that Website where you can \"Name Your Own Price\" (can't mention it by name here or they won't post this) to get the best rate possible on a top-tier hotel, but since I was traveling alone and was on a tight budget this time, I decided to go with a mid-range property. I bid $50 at the 2-and-a-half-star level and the Executive Inn accepted my offer. I booked it for just one night because I wasn't sure what to expect and didn't want to risk getting stuck in someplace unacceptable for my entire stay. I realized the evening of my arrival that I'd be getting in really late, and I called them to let them know; the front desk agent was super nice and did a great job giving me directions. When I got there (around 3 am) I parked on the street. Check-in was fast and easy and he comped me a parking pass for the hotel garage because of the late hour, which saved me from either paying $15 or getting up by 8 to feed the meter. I got to the room and found it to be large and clean with a refrigerator and microwave. I was dead tired but impressed enough with the value that I fired up my laptop and used the free Wi-Fi to ask Capt. Kirk to bid on another night at the same rate --which was accepted -- before going to bed. I got up in time to hit the free breakfast buffet and was blown away by the selection: lots of hot items (scrambled eggs, potatoes, link sausages, make-your-own waffles), bagels, yogurt, several kinds of cold cereal, a selection of fruit juices and decent local name-brand coffee. The plates and bowls are disposable (think Chinet) and so are the kind-of-flimsy utensils, but it's all compostable and what isn't composted is recycled. So if being environmentally conscious is important to you, this is a great place to stay. There are recycling bins in every room and the vanities and showers have dispensers for soap, shampoo, conditioner and moisturizer rather than individual packages. And while some might say the property \"needs a little updating\", not ripping out fixtures and finishes every few years is an earth-friendly approach. Ultimately, I was happy enough to book a third night too. I switched rooms after the first night to get an even-numbered room on an upper floor with a western exposure and a great view of the Space Needle which is a couple of blocks away. The odd-numbered rooms have a \"city view\", but it's more alley than skyline. The Executive Inn may not be elegant or trendy, but it's clean and I found all the staff to be friendly and helpful. I'ts not someplace I'd book for a special occasion or stay with someone I wanted to impress, but otherwise I'd definitely stay there again if I could get a bargain rate like that.

The manager suggested a grungy hotel down the road. They had cash, and our credit card and we even talked to the manager, but he told us he could not make any exceptions, as this would be discrimination. I think that it is discrimination to the teenagers, as they would not rent to them with our approval, written or verbal. I can make purchases online, but somehow I could not even place my credit card as security for the price of the room and other expenses. Some policies are too strict and some exceptions should always be allowed. I spoke to Best Western head office and they told me that all Best Westerns were individually owned and operated, therefore the policy was only with this one hotel.

Best decision I ever made!! My pros: - Everything is within walking distance (Space Needle is practically in your backyard, Belltown with all the restaurants, bars, and clubs is just a few blocks down the street and the Pike Place market is about a 10 minute walk away or you can hop on a bus to go deeper downtown, etc) - Rooms are clean. - Heater worked really well - They have room service, and their staff of servers are pretty considerate and nice - FREE wireless internet service and it's fast! - Room service called us to ask if we needed new towels or anything else. - My boyfriend bought fish at Pike's Market, which was delivered to this hotel. They were nice enough to store it in their restaurant freezer for us free of charge! Some cons: - You have to pay for parking - The hallways kind of scared me upon getting off the elevator because it seemed pretty dingy (they need to do some steam cleaning or something - I would not want to walk around on bare feet!) - The construction zone next to the hotel might worry people but seriously, we didn't hear any of that noise through the walls or anything in the morning. - The people at the front desk can be a little nicer but that really wasn't a big deal to us.
