The room that I stayed in did not have a smoke detector. It was wired in on the ceiling, but no device was there. Another guest told me lady they did not have a smoke detector. The elevator is dirty and looks more like a service elevator than one for guests. Our room smelled of smoke, eventhough we asked for non-smoking. The pool area at this property was not properly maintained. While I was there, a little paper sign stated the Spa was not working, but children and adults still used it. If the spa was off limits, they should have covered or roped it off to prevent people from using it. Sunday morning, the pool deck was littered with beer cans and trash. It was not cleaned up until about 10 am. There was no sign on or around the pool area for the hours of the pool and spa-at 7:30 am there were kids and adults in the pool. At that time the deep end was cloudy. I went to the front desk and asked them when the pool got cleaned. They said he would be there. Sometime after 10 am I noticed the pool had turned green and you could not see the bottom of the deep end. The pool guy finally got there and I spoke to the him. He said he could not correct the problem and I went back to front desk to discuss the pool and asked for a discount on my stay as I clearly would not have stayed there without a pool. They gave me $10 off, but with attitude! I still paid more for this hotel than one without a pool. The on-site manager told me it was inspected this morning and they would not be closing the pool as it was fine. I repeated back to her calmly, \u201cyou are telling me that the county came and inspected it today?...it is Sunday\u201d She said yes. That is not true! The management should have been truthful about such an important issue. Today I contacted the Swimming Pool Inspection department for Maricopa County. I knew the manager lied about a serious public health problem. The last date this pool was inspected by the county was September 2011. No inspection occured on Sunday, the County told me they don't work on the weekends. You do not lie to customers to make them happy, especially about a public safety issue. I also waited very long to get a print-out of my bill - over 10 minutes to print it out! Front desk seemed over-worked and stressed. It makes sense when the property is so run-down....they must have to deal with all sorts of problems and cranky customers. Property owner should take care of problems and make this a good hotel and train your employees how to deal with problems. customer service is key in the hotel business.

I was shocked to see how run down the hotel was. The surrounding area was dirty and there were many people wandering around. Before entering the hotel, I knew I would not feel safe. We never did stay there, so I cannot comment on the rooms. However, the lobby area was dark and dingy. I do have to say that the gentleman who helped me allowed us additional time to find an alternative hotel. This is not somewhere I would consider staying at again. It was dirty and did not promote a feeling of safety or comfort.", "Date": "April 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prescott, AZ", "Title": "\u201cNo Comfort Here\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3194278", "Content": "Our first room was right over the laundry (we asked for a quiet room). The dryer vents were so loud, I thought we were next to a jet runway. The carpet was extremely dirty. No remote for the TV, which had a 1/2 black screen anyway, so you couldn't really watch TV. After we changed to a quieter room with a TV that worked, we found that the carpet was extremely dirty in this room, too. After the smokers moved in next door (we're non-smokers), the smoke drifted into our room, too---maybe through the thin walls. Huh!?! Lots of transients wandering through the parking lot, so I never went out alone.

The sound of the shower from an adjoining room was so loud that we thought it was our toilet running.There was plenty of hot water, however, it was so hot that you could easily scald yourself if you weren't very careful. Only one washcloth was provided. Last but not least the carpet was so dirty that when I stepped into the tub to shower the water became muddy.
